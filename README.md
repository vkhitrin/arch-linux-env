Personal configuration and tooling for Arch Linux.

Dotfiles are stored externally in a separate repository [vkhitrin/dotfiles](https://github.com/vkhitrin/dotfiles).

At the moment, I am using [COSMIC](https://system76.com/cosmic) DE.

## Installation

Use `make` command to perform actions.

## TODO

- [ ] Consider consolidating [macOS](https://github.com/vkhitrin/macos-env) and Arch Linux bootstrapping into a single repo (or at least maintain a single copy of identical scripts).
- [ ] Add `catpuccin` theming to applications/utilities.
- [ ] Conditional bootstrapping based on hardware.
- [ ] Private customizations.
